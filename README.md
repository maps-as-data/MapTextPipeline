## Introduction

The [ICDAR Robust Reading Competition](https://rrc.cvc.uab.es/) is internationally recognized as an authoritative event in the field of text recognition. 
The data evaluation and metrics in top conference papers in the text recognition field often come from ICDAR competition data and metrics. 
Generally, there are several major events each year, and each event is further divided into 3-4 competitions.

Text on digitized historical maps contains valuable information providing georeferenced political and cultural context, yet the wealth of information in digitized historical maps remains largely inaccessible due to their unsearchable raster format. 
The [ICDAR24 MapText Competition](https://rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=28&com=introduction) aims to address the unique challenges of **detecting and recognizing** textual information (e.g., place names) and **linking** words to form location phrases on historical maps.

This project is one of the current [leaders](https://rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=28&com=evaluation&task=3) in the MapText competition.
